## Objective
The past year has been one of the most difficult years for many people, the rise of COVID-19 affected millions. Other than being a highly infectious disease, COVID-19 has affected our education, the economy, our every day lives and our mental health. As humans we need social interactions and being in isolation has affected millions of people's mental health. Being in isolation leaves a lot of us stuck in our thoughts without nobody to support us sometimes. We decided to build a mobile application to help everyone in need of mental support. Whenever you are feeling down and need something to cheer you up, you can check the app to see some memes, watch dog/cat videos or read some postive aricles, quotes and facts. You can also set reminders to take a walk, drink water, meditate, take your pills or even check up on a friend every now and then. If you are still feeling uneasy and need more support the app takes you to a hotline for more help.
